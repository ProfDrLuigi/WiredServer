# Wired Server Source Code

This repository hosts Wired Server source code. You will find an Xcode project named "WiredServer.xcworkspace" that contains a Wired Server target ready to deploy a 10.13+ compatible application (x64/ARM).

## Prerequisites

- Mac OS X 10.13+
- Xcode 13+

## How to compile Wired Server

1. Clone Github Repo :

		git clone https://github.com/profdrluigi/WiredServer.git

		
3. Open `WiredServer.xcworkspace`

4. Select scheme `Wired Server` and be sure to use "Release" Build Configuration

5. Launch Build, Wired Server.app should launch automatically when finished

## How to create U2B for the "wired" Binary

To creating a Universal Binary (the 'wired' Server Binary itself, not the Wired Server Application) you need to compile the XCode Project on a M- and Intel Mac/Hackintosh.

On a M Mac:

- Build 
- Go into

		"Wired Server.app/Contents/Resources/Wired" 

and copy the file
		
		"wired"
to Desktop and rename it to

		"wired_arm"
	
On an Intel Mac:

- Build 
- Go into

		"Wired Server.app/Contents/Resources/Wired" 

and copy the file
		
		"wired"
to Desktop and rename it to

		"wired_x86"

### Making U2B of the 2 Binaries

Now open the Terminal and type

		lipo -create ~/Desktop/wired_arm ~/Desktop/wired_x86 -output ~/Desktop/wired

Now copy the new created "wired" Binary to:

		"Wired Server.app/Contents/Resources/Wired" 

and overwrite the old one.

Done. Now you have a fully U2B Server.

## Troubleshooting

Be sure that "wired" target is listed in Taget Dependencies Build Phases of Wired Server target. If not, add it in order to compile wired binary for Mac.

If you got the error that the Application can not be opened because it's damaged you must put it out of the Quarantain. Type in Terminal:

  		xattr -rc "/Applications/Wired Server.app"

 (or another Path where you have the App) and you should be good to go.
